# SoccerSum Dataset

This page provides an overview of the SoccerSum Dataset, which was described in the dataset paper "The SoccerSum Dataset for Automated Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking of Objects on the Soccer Pitch" and used for the demo paper "Multimodal AI-Based Summarization and Storytelling for Soccer on Social Media" (see [Citations](#citations)). 

The SoccerSum dataset was curated by capturing and annotating soccer videos from the Norwegian Eliteserien league. This collection spans three years, covering 2021, 2022, and 2023. It comprises 750 frames from 41 unique sequences, with 4 to 40 frames per sequence, carefully chosen to represent a diverse selection of scenarios encountered in professional soccer games.

## Dataset Overview

The SoccerSum Dataset can be used for two primary tasks:

1. **Soccer Object Detection**
2. **Soccer Pitch Segmentation**

### Soccer Object Detection

For the object detection task, the dataset includes the following eight classes:

- `0` = Player
- `1` = Goalkeeper
- `2` = Referee
- `3` = Ball
- `4` = Logo
- `5` = Penalty Mark
- `6` = Corner Flagpost
- `7` = Goal Net

### Soccer Pitch Segmentation

For the segmentation task, the dataset includes the following two classes:

- `0` = Penalty Box
- `1` = Goal Box
